# GitHub Actions Lab 1
# GitHub Actions Lab 1 - Q1

This repository demonstrates a basic GitHub Actions workflow setup using a `python-workflow.yml` file. The purpose of this lab is to understand how GitHub Actions are triggered and how workflows execute in a CI/CD pipeline.

## Repository Overview

- **Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/python-workflow.yml`
- **Main Feature:** The workflow is triggered on push events to run Python-related tasks (such as linting, testing, or formatting).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   - Go to the **Actions** tab of this repository.
   - Click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"** to activate GitHub Actions for the first time.

2. **Make a Change**
   - Open the `README.md` file.
   - Add a random new line of text at the bottom.
   - Commit and push the changes to the repository.

3. **Observe the Workflow**
   - Return to the **Actions** tab.
   - Select the workflow that was triggered (usually named **python-workflow**).
